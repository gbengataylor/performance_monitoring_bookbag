== Deploying the Microservices 

In this module you'll learn how to deploy the Java applications using OpenShift Pipelines (based on https://tekton.dev/[Tekton]).



Tekton is a CI/CD tool made especifically to run in a Kubernetes environment. It takes advantage of containers and shared resources, such as https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[volumes], to create reproducible processes to facilitate the creation of automation https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/[pipelines].

You won't need to create your pipeline from scratch. To reduce the complexity, we already provisioned a pipeline for you in the `userx-cicd` namespace. You just need to learn what it does and how to run it.

=== Understanding the pipeline

In the *Developer view*, select the `userx-cicd` project. Then, on the right side menu, click on *Pipelines*.
